    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently a friend of mine asked &quot;should my close person X, who is just starting in QA field learn how to test web applications using Cypress.io test runner or go with Selenium?&quot; Here is my answer, which you should take with a grain of salt - I work at Cypress!</p><p>Whenever you start in a new field, you have to quickly get up to speed so <em>you are productive in a real company</em>. A testing tool you pick thus needs to have an approachable learning curve, and be simple to start with, and be powerful to handle testing modern web apps.</p><h2><span id="installation">Installation 💾</span></h2><p>Here is where Cypress test runner shines: to install the Cypress test runner you need just a single command: <code>npm i -D cypress</code>.</p><p><img src="/blog/images/cy/1-installing.gif" alt="Installing Cypress"></p><p>I could have stopped right there. But seriously, we built Cypress using the most popular programming language - JavaScript, on top of cross-platform Electron application (same app that powers VSCode, Slack and Spotify) and we distribute the test runner via the largest code sharing repository in the world: NPM registry. Trying out Cypress should <em>be easy</em> on every platform. If it is not, open an issue on <a href="https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> and we will see if we can simplify it even more.</p><h2><span id="documentation">Documentation 📚</span></h2><p>We have invested a lot of our engineering time (at the order of 25% of the total development time) in our <a href="https://docs.cypress.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://docs.cypress.io/</a> site plus <a href="https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-recipes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-recipes</a> plus <a href="https://www.cypress.io/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.cypress.io/blog/</a> plus all the other example repositories. And we keep <a href="https://www.cypress.io/blog/2018/08/22/takeaways-from-write-the-docs-cincinnati/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learning how to make the docs better</a>.</p><p>Our users can freely contribute to the documentation by submitting to <a href="https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-documentation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cypress-documentation</a>, and have improved them tremendously. As of today, there were <a href="https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-documentation/graphs/contributors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">93 contributors</a> to the docs, and we cannot thank everyone enough.</p><p>If you are starting in testing, having complete guides like <a href="https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/writing-your-first-test.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How to write your first test</a>, or how to <a href="https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/writing-and-organizing-tests.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">organize your code and test</a>, or how <a href="https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/continuous-integration.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to run your tests on CI</a> is a MUST. You will learn the basics of test writing, and will gradually improve as you go along.</p><p>We have docs for <a href="https://docs.cypress.io/api/introduction/api.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">every command</a>, <a href="https://docs.cypress.io/examples/examples/tutorials.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video tutorials</a> for people who want to watch and learn, and even open source <a href="https://docs.cypress.io/examples/examples/workshop.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">workshop material</a>. Pick what suites your learning style and take the first step; you will progress very quickly.</p><p><img src="/blog/images/cy/docs-tweet.png" alt="Cypress and its docs"></p><h2><span id="productivity">Productivity 📈</span></h2><p>Your first job as a QA might ask you to ensure that the web app functions as intended. As in:</p><ul><li>user visits the site</li><li>user clicks on the input field</li><li>user enters text and presses Enter key</li><li>app does something in response</li></ul><p>Notice how the test is <em>functional</em> - the test exercises primarily how the web application behaves. So Cypress is 100% focused on writing such tests. The above test will probably look like this</p><figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">it(<span class="string">'works'</span>, () =&gt; &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="comment">// visit local url, or remote url</span></span><br><span class="line">  cy.visit(<span class="string">'http://localhost:3000'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="comment">// type into specific box</span></span><br><span class="line">  cy.get(<span class="string">'.input-box'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">    .click()</span><br><span class="line">    .type(<span class="string">'my text&#123;enter&#125;'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="comment">// assert the app shows the result</span></span><br><span class="line">  cy.get(<span class="string">'.result'</span>).should(<span class="string">'be.visible'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">&#125;)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>The Cypress test looks <em>soooo much</em> like the user story, it should NOT be difficult to learn how to write them, even if you are just starting with JavaScript. As you write the code, you can keep the test runner open, and it will rerun the test when you change and save the test file.</p><p><img src="/blog/images/cy/2-writing.gif" alt="Writing test"></p><p>And Cypress ships with TypeScript definitions, that show up as <a href="https://on.cypress.io/intelligent-code-completion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IntelliSense help</a> in most text editors. It is simple to write and change Cypress tests; and it is not just the API design or documentation - it is the test runner itself!</p><h2><span id="debugging">Debugging 💻</span></h2><p>The test runner shows every command as the test runs, and you can go back and see how the application looked during each step. The time-travelling debugger that keeps the DOM snapshots is huge help for anyone writing or debugging a failing Cypress end-to-end test.</p><p><img src="/blog/images/cy/4-debugging.gif" alt="Debugging Cypress test"></p><p>This goes back to the Productivity section below - you will be more productive by using Cypress. Not only your tests will be quick to run, but writing new tests and debugging failed ones will be fast.</p><h2><span id="popularity-️">Popularity ⭐️</span></h2><p>According to GitHub star counts (and these are the best predictors, right?) Cypress is in the same leagues as other E2E testing tools, after being open sourced for 10 months. Yup, it is growing fast.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Repo</th><th>Stars</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Selenum</td><td><a href="https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SeleniumHQ/selenium</a></td><td>11k</td></tr><tr><td>Karma</td><td><a href="https://github.com/karma-runner/karma" target="_blank" rel="noopener">karma-runner/karma</a></td><td>10k</td></tr><tr><td>Nightwatch</td><td><a href="https://github.com/nightwatchjs/nightwatch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nightwatchjs/nightwatch</a></td><td>8k</td></tr><tr><td>Protractor</td><td><a href="https://github.com/angular/protractor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">angular/protractor</a></td><td>7.7k</td></tr><tr><td>Cypress</td><td><a href="https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cypress-io/cypress</a></td><td>7.3k</td></tr></tbody></table><p>It is more that just the test runner itself growing quickly in popularity as more people discover it. The SaaS services we have built on top of the test runner are optional, yet we have 20% <em>month over month</em> growth in number of organization and projects recording test results and test artifacts on <a href="http://on.cypress.io/dashboard-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cypress Dashboard</a>. So we must be doing something right! Learning how to write Cypress tests and use our Dashboard to <a href="http://on.cypress.io/parallelization" target="_blank" rel="noopener">parallelize test runs</a> for example, might be what your next job is looking for.</p><h2><span id="bonus">Bonus 🎁</span></h2><p>Cypress is framework-agnostic. You only work via a well-documented commands against the standard browser APIs like DOM, local storage, cookies, location, history, requests, etc. So learning how to test with Cypress a React application for example, translates into learning how to test <em>any application</em>.</p><p>You will also learn how modern browsers work. The tests run in a regular browser (Chrome), you can open DevTools, interact with the application, run custom code, see how each step changes the DOM, sets cookies, communicates with the server backend, etc. You will not be siloed into QA role away from the development roles, and as time progresses should be able to meaningfully contribute to designing code for greater testability and maintainability. With time, you might find yourself writing more code than tests, if that&#39;s something you find enjoyable.</p><h2><span id="other-opinions">Other opinions 🎤</span></h2><p>Of course, there are people who disagree with me. After all, Selenium has been around for a while, and it is an official RFC standard. It will be a popular tool for a long time, no doubt. Its cross-browser and multiple language bindings are certainly very attractive. Read the following <code>Cypress vs Selenium</code> blog posts and see if their arguments convince you.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.future-processing.pl/blog/cypress-io-the-reason-why-were-not-stuck-with-selenium/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cypress.io – the reason why we’re not stuck with Selenium</a></li><li><a href="https://automationrhapsody.com/cypress-vs-selenium-end-era/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cypress vs. Selenium, is this the end of an era?</a></li><li><a href="https://medium.com/@shivambharadwaj/https-medium-com-shivambharadwaj-why-you-should-switch-to-cypress-for-modern-web-testing-5d3739a19e6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Why you should switch to Cypress for modern web testing?</a></li><li><a href="https://medium.com/@wataruoguchi/running-e2e-tests-with-selenium-and-cypress-1de69b95d936" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Running E2E tests with Selenium <em>AND</em> Cypress</a></li><li><a href="https://medium.com/tech-quizlet/cypress-the-future-of-end-to-end-testing-for-web-applications-8ee108c5b255" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cypress: The future of end-to-end testing for web applications</a></li><li>and <a href="http://on.cypress.io/blogs-media" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many more</a></li></ul><p>There were a couple of threads on Reddit discussion Cypress</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/97hktn/how_many_of_you_use_cypress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How many of you use Cypress ?</a></li><li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/8rhnv3/i_want_to_learn_automate_ui_testing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I want to learn automate UI testing</a></li></ul><h2><span id="cypress-limits-️">Cypress limits ⚠️</span></h2><p>You should also be aware of Cypress limitations.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2><span id="tested-pr-deploys">Tested PR deploys</span></h2><p>Recent news: <a href="https://zeit.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zeit.co</a> has released a GitHub app for automatically deploying GitHub pull requests using <a href="https://zeit.co/blog/new-static-deployments" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zeit Now tool</a>. Previously, I have been a huge fan of testing my code on Now cloud using immutable deploys - read <a href="../immutable-deploys-with-data-and-testing/">Immutable deploys and Cypress</a> and try my helper tool <a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/now-pipeline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now-pipeline</a>. Now (excuse my pun), I wanted to see if I could run the same tests on each pull request without any custom tooling, just by using <a href="https://zeit.co/blog/now-for-github" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zeit GitHub app</a>.</p><p>So I made a tiny static repo <a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/tiny-blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bahmutov/tiny-blog</a> and connected it to the &quot;Now&quot; GitHub application.</p><p><img src="/blog/images/zeit-github/github-now.png" alt="Now GitHub application"></p><p>My example is a static site, which I configure using <a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/tiny-blog/blob/master/now.json" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tiny-blog/now.json</a> file</p><figure class="highlight json"><figcaption><span>now.json</span></figcaption><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="attr">"type"</span>: <span class="string">"static"</span></span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>I needed to add a Dockerfile to test and serve my site. Zeit Now can be used for Node deploys, but its full power lies in running <em>any</em> Docker-based project. So I have added a <a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/tiny-blog/blob/master/Dockerfile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dockerfile</a> that runs end-to-end tests against a local site using <a href="https://www.cypress.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cypress.io</a> test runner. The <a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/tiny-blog/blob/master/Dockerfile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dockerfile</a> looks intimidating, but as I explain in <a href="https://www.cypress.io/blog/2018/08/08/Fast-Tests-Tiny-Docker-Image/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fast Tests, Tiny Docker Image</a> blog post, it only looks complicated because I build two images - one to run end-to-end tests, and another to actually serve the static site in production. By using <a href="../making-small-docker-image/">Docker multi-stage build feature</a> we can keep the production image really really small - because it will NOT include tests or test dependencies. In summary, the Dockerfile looks like this</p><figure class="highlight dockerfile"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br><span class="line">20</span><br><span class="line">21</span><br><span class="line">22</span><br><span class="line">23</span><br><span class="line">24</span><br><span class="line">25</span><br><span class="line">26</span><br><span class="line">27</span><br><span class="line">28</span><br><span class="line">29</span><br><span class="line">30</span><br><span class="line">31</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">#</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment"># Testing image</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">#</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">FROM</span> cypress/base:<span class="number">10</span> as TEST</span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment"># dependencies will be installed only if the package files change</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">COPY</span><span class="bash"> package.json .</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="bash">COPY package-lock.json .</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="bash"><span class="comment"># by setting CI environment variable we switch the Cypress install messages</span></span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="bash"><span class="comment"># to small "started / finished" and avoid 1000s of lines of progress messages</span></span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="bash"><span class="comment"># https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1243</span></span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="bash">ENV CI=1</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="bash">RUN npm ci</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="bash"><span class="comment"># tests will rerun if the "cypress" folder, "cypress.json" file or "public" folder</span></span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="bash"><span class="comment"># has any changes</span></span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="bash"><span class="comment"># copy tests</span></span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="bash">COPY cypress cypress</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="bash">COPY cypress.json .</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="bash"><span class="comment"># copy what to test</span></span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="bash">COPY public public</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="bash"><span class="comment">#</span></span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="bash"><span class="comment"># run e2e Cypress tests</span></span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="bash"><span class="comment">#</span></span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="bash">RUN npm <span class="built_in">test</span></span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="bash"></span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="bash"><span class="comment">#</span></span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="bash"><span class="comment"># Production image - without Cypress and node modules!</span></span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="bash"><span class="comment">#</span></span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="bash">FROM busybox as PROD</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="bash">COPY --from=TEST /app/public /public</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="bash"><span class="comment"># nothing to do - Zeit should take care of serving static content</span></span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="bash"><span class="comment"># we would only need a command if we want to use this image locally</span></span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>That is it - and the best part is that you can build this Docker image locally to make sure it is working!

    <title>Incredibly Powerful cy.task</title>

    <updated>2018-06-27T14:47:51.000Z</updated>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There is a new super powerful command in <a href="https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/changelog.html#3-0-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cypress v3</a> - and that is <a href="https://on.cypress.io/task" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>cy.task</code></a>. This command allows your tests to &quot;jump&quot; from the browser context to Node and run <em>any code</em> before returning (asynchronously) the result back to the test. Let me show how to use this command for &quot;deeper&quot; server-side validation.</p><p>Let me take a TodoMVC application as an example. This is the same web application I have tested <em>a lot</em> in <a href="https://www.cypress.io/blog/2017/11/28/testing-vue-web-application-with-vuex-data-store-and-rest-backend/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Testing Vue web applications with Vuex data store &amp; REST backend</a> blog post. You can find all code from this blog post in <a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-task-demo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bahmutov/cypress-task-demo</a> repository.</p><p>The TodoMVC application sends each new todo item entered by the user to the backend server (via XHR calls). The backend is <a href="https://github.com/typicode/json-server" target="_blank" rel="noopener">json-server</a> that saves the data as a plain JSON file called <code>data.json</code>. Good. So how can we assert that all parts of the system are working as expected?</p><h2><span id="testing-the-ui">Testing the UI</span></h2><p>The most obvious thing that everyone writing end-to-end tests should do is to only exercise the application via its user interface. For example, we can add a new todo item, and then confirm that the text of the item appears in the list below.</p><figure class="highlight js"><figcaption><span>ui.js</span></figcaption><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> &#123; enterTodo, resetDatabase &#125; <span class="keyword">from</span> <span class="string">'./utils'</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">describe(<span class="string">'UI'</span>, () =&gt; &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  beforeEach(resetDatabase)</span><br><span class="line">  beforeEach(<span class="function"><span class="params">()</span> =&gt;</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    cy.visit(<span class="string">'/'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;)</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  it(<span class="string">'adds todo'</span>, () =&gt; &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment">// random text to avoid confusion</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">const</span> id = Cypress._.random(<span class="number">1</span>, <span class="number">1e6</span>)</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">const</span> title = <span class="string">`todo <span class="subst">$&#123;id&#125;</span>`</span></span><br><span class="line">    enterTodo(title)</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment">// confirm the new item has been added to the list</span></span><br><span class="line">    cy.contains(<span class="string">'.todoapp li'</span>, title)</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;)</span><br><span class="line">&#125;)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Here is this test in action; I am hovering over &quot;CONTAINS&quot; command and Cypress highlights the new item in the DOM snapshots at that moment in test.</p><p><img src="/blog/images/powerful-cy-task/confirm-new-item-via-ui.gif" alt="Confirms new item has been added via UI"></p><p>The new item appears in the list, but was it <em>really</em> sent to the server? We could write another test to spy on the XHR call to observe the new item being sent to the server. But was the item <em>really</em> saved? Hmm, we are going deeper in the implementation details here. Why not avoid testing the <em>implementation</em> of the application and the server and instead test the <em>external</em> state - in this case the file &quot;database&quot; where the server saves data?</p><h2><span id="testing-the-database">Testing the database</span></h2><p>So every time the user enters new Todo item, it should be saved in the file &quot;data.json&quot; like this</p><figure class="highlight json"><figcaption><span>data.json</span></figcaption><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="attr">"todos"</span>: [</span><br><span class="line">    &#123;</span><br><span class="line">      <span class="attr">"title"</span>: <span class="string">"todo 423665"</span>,</span><br><span class="line">      <span class="attr">"completed"</span>: <span class="literal">false</span>,</span><br><span class="line">      <span class="attr">"id"</span>: <span class="string">"9197021112"</span></span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">  ]</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>We can write a test that adds an item via UI, but then checks the database to make sure the new record has been added. There is <a href="https://on.cypress.io/readfile" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>cy.readFile</code></a> that can read file contents, but it is not powerful enough:</p><ul><li><code>cy.readFile</code> fails the test if the file does not exist</li><li>we want to write general code that can actually query any database, not just read a file.</li></ul><p>The new command <a href="https://on.cypress.io/task" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>cy.task</code></a> allows us to do <em>anything</em>.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>End-to-end test tool like <a href="https://www.cypress.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cypress.io</a> usually loads a complete page from a web server and executes a series of test commands against it. Recently I have introduced a series of framework-specific adaptors that allow running end-to-end tests against individual <em>components</em> rather than web pages. You can find more details about this approach from these links</p><ul><li>read the blog post <a href="https://www.cypress.io/blog/2018/04/02/sliding-down-the-testing-pyramid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sliding Down the Testing Pyramid</a> that explains the principles behind component testing using E2E test runner</li><li>watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FnalKRjpZk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AssertJS video</a> (<a href="https://slides.com/bahmutov/assertjs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slides</a>) where I talk about this approach</li><li>take a look at <a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-vue-unit-test" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cypress-vue-unit-test</a> repo which has a typical adaptor for Vue.js framework.</li></ul><p>A typical component is loaded by the spec file and is &quot;mounted&quot; inside Cypress and becomes &quot;live&quot; mini web application. Here is a typical &#39;counter&#39; example for Vue framework.</p><figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> ButtonCounter <span class="keyword">from</span> <span class="string">'../../components/ButtonCounter.vue'</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> mount = <span class="built_in">require</span>(<span class="string">'cypress-vue-unit-test'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">describe(<span class="string">'ButtonCounter'</span>, () =&gt; &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  beforeEach(mount(ButtonCounter))</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  it(<span class="string">'starts with zero'</span>, () =&gt; &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    cy.contains(<span class="string">'button'</span>, <span class="string">'0'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;)</span><br><span class="line">&#125;)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Notice that even with framework-specific <code>mount</code> function, the rest of interaction with the component and the testing goes through the standard browser interfaces: DOM, network, events. This makes Cypress tests very portable - because they really are not tied to a specific implementation.</p><p>But there is a problem here, and it is that <code>import Button from &#39;...&#39;</code> statement. But first, let me explain how the test code is separated from the application&#39;s code.</p><h2><span id="e2e-vs-component">E2E vs Component</span></h2><p>Let me explain the iframing in Cypress. Here is a typical end-to-end test that loads a page &quot;localhost:3000&quot;</p><figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">it(<span class="string">'opens the page'</span>, () =&gt; &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  cy.visit(<span class="string">'http://localhost:3000'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">&#125;)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>When this test executes, Cypress runs the website &quot;localhost:3000&quot; inside an <em>iframe</em> called &quot;Your App ...&quot;. Here is the app iframe highlighted in the browser. Notice different JavaScript contexts in the DevTools.</p><p><img src="/blog/images/rolling-for-test/app-iframe.png" alt="App iframe and separate JavaScript contexts"></p><p>The test JavaScript runs in a separate iframe called &quot;Your Spec ...&quot; and thus is a walled off garden away from the application&#39;s code.

It bundles the component code (and possible the framework code) and <em>executes</em> the code in the &quot;Your Spec ...&quot; iframe. Hmm. That might be ... a problem. And it is! Often your component loads styles, which creates style sheets, which ... get attached to the WRONG <code>document</code> element! Thus the <code>mount</code> function for example <em>copies</em> style nodes from the &quot;Your Spec ...&quot; iframe to &quot;Your App ...&quot; iframe. There are other problems like this - styles are extremely problematic because the bundling logic often executes immediately once per spec file, and we need it to execute <em>before each</em> test.</p><p>I had such hard time making CSS-in-JS libraries like <a href="https://github.com/morishitter/picostyle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">picostyle</a> work with components, that this is still an open <a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-hyperapp-unit-test/issues/6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issue #6</a> in <a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-hyperapp-unit-test" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cypress-hyperapp-unit-test</a>.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I love documenting things. I hate when my documentation is out of date. For unit tests I have built a tool called <a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/xplain#readme" target="_blank" rel="noopener">xplain</a> to convert unit tests into Markdown examples to be included in README. But what about UI components? Turns out you can have an interactive documentation for your components with a new tool called <a href="https://docz.site" target="_blank" rel="noopener">docz</a> that is just a pleasure to use. Currently <code>docz</code> supports only React components, but support for other frameworks might be coming.</p><h2><span id="live-documentation-with-docz">Live documentation with Docz</span></h2><p><code>docz</code> uses <a href="https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MDX document</a> format which is a Markdown enhanced with JSX. If you want to see Docz in action, take a look at the short intro video by clicking the link below the image.</p><p><a href="https://www.docz.site?wvideo=cl69p284xk" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://embedwistia-a.akamaihd.net/deliveries/8ac81e1f0fc13c9401a4da81cbe97cf807653611.jpg?image_play_button_size=2x&amp;image_crop_resized=960x540&amp;image_play_button=1&amp;image_play_button_color=4568f3e0" alt="See docz preview video by clicking on this link"></a></p><p>Great, so we can write component documentation <em>really quickly</em>, and our documentation site is interactive! Take a look at the example repo <a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/cy-docz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bahmutov/cy-docz</a> - just a couple of components, with <code>Button</code> component showing &quot;onClick&quot; handler that does &quot;alert&quot; message. Clone the repo, start the <code>docz</code> server with <code>npm run dev</code> and open <code>localhost:3000</code> - the documentation is live</p><p><img src="/blog/images/cy-docz/docz-alert.gif" alt="Button onClick triggers alert"></p><p>Here is the relevant part from the <code>Button.mdx</code></p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">---</span><br><span class="line">name: Button</span><br><span class="line">menu: Components</span><br><span class="line">---</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">import &#123; Playground &#125; from &apos;docz&apos;</span><br><span class="line">import Button from &apos;./Button&apos;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">## With onclick handler</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">&lt;Playground&gt;</span><br><span class="line">    &lt;Button onClick=&#123;() =&gt; alert(&apos;hi there&apos;)&#125;&gt;Shows alert&lt;/Button&gt;</span><br><span class="line">&lt;/Playground&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p><strong>Tip:</strong> you can create &quot;index&quot; page by creating a MDX file with &quot;route /&quot; meta setting.</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">---</span><br><span class="line">name: Index page</span><br><span class="line">route: /</span><br><span class="line">order: 1</span><br><span class="line">---</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">This will be the index page</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>And now let us make sure our documentation is never out of date with respect to the source component.

We can sleep better knowing that our documentation is really working. You can find a few more tests I wrote against <code>Button.mdx</code> in <a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/cy-docz/blob/master/components/Button-spec.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener">components/Button-spec.js</a></p><h2><span id="running-tests">Running tests</span></h2><p>How can we run <code>docz</code> and test it quickly? We need to start the <code>docz</code> server, wait for it to finish bundling (it might take a few seconds even for small projects), then run Cypress tests. There is a utility <a href="http://github.com/bahmutov/start-server-and-test#readme" target="_blank" rel="noopener">start-server-and-test</a> I wrote that makes it easy.

Luckily, Cypress keeps DOM snapshots for each command. We can click on the <code>type(&#39;about&#39;)</code> command and pin the <em>after</em> snapshot. Now we can take a look at the DOM node in the Elements tab without &quot;scaring it away&quot;.</p><p><img src="/blog/images/vuepress/after-snapshot.png" alt="After command snapshot"></p><p>We can write the search results assertions in several ways. We want to make sure the list of results has at least 1 found item, and that the first result has the page title &quot;About&quot;.</p><figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">it(<span class="string">'finds the about page'</span>, () =&gt; &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  cy.get(<span class="string">'.search-box input'</span>).type(<span class="string">'about'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">  cy.get(<span class="string">'.suggestions'</span>).find(<span class="string">'li'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">    .should(<span class="string">'be.visible'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">    .and(<span class="string">'have.length.gte'</span>, <span class="number">1</span>)</span><br><span class="line">    .first()</span><br><span class="line">    .contains(<span class="string">'.page-title'</span>, <span class="string">'About'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">    .click()</span><br><span class="line">  cy.title().should(<span class="string">'contain'</span>, <span class="string">'About'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">&#125;)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>The alternating &quot;query / assertion&quot; pattern shown above is the best way to make sure Cypress successfully goes step by step. The test runner retries the &quot;query&quot; step until the &quot;assertion&quot; passes. Thus by explicitly looking for visible suggestions to have a few items we make sure the application really behaves the way we think it should behave during the test.</p><p><img src="/blog/images/vuepress/search-test.png" alt="Search test finishes in About page"></p><p>Hmm, our <code>cy.title()</code> assertion only compared part of the full title. The full title was &quot;Try Vuepress | About&quot; which is the concatenation of the blog&#39;s and the page&#39;s titles. But the blog&#39;s title is specified in the <code>src/.vuepress/config.js</code>. Do we need to duplicate the blog title and put it into the spec file? No, we can import any JavaScript directly from our test file, thus reusing application&#39;s configuration.</p><figure class="highlight js"><figcaption><span>cypress/integration/spec.js</span></figcaption><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">/// &lt;reference types="cypress" /&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> &#123;title&#125; <span class="keyword">from</span> <span class="string">'../../src/.vuepress/config'</span></span><br><span class="line">describe(<span class="string">'VuePress site'</span>, () =&gt; &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  it(<span class="string">'finds the about page'</span>, () =&gt; &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment">// same test code</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment">// ...</span></span><br><span class="line">    cy.title().should(<span class="string">'equal'</span>, <span class="string">`<span class="subst">$&#123;title&#125;</span> | About`</span>)</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;)</span><br><span class="line">&#125;)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Our assertion is a lot stricter now!</p>]]></content>

But I often was in a situation in a large unfamiliar codebase where after a small change, my tests would start failing with <em>very weird errors</em>. It was very hard to debug such cases, because often the original stubbed method was returning a promise - and now returning <code>undefined</code> caused all sorts of errors with weird stack traces!</p><p>We can lock down the stub by forcing it to throw an error for <em>every unknown argument</em> using <code>stub.throws()</code> method, we can even pass a text message to become a thrown error.</p><figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">sinon.stub(o, <span class="string">'say'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">  .throws(<span class="string">'nope'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">  .withArgs(<span class="string">'foo'</span>).returns(<span class="number">42</span>)</span><br><span class="line">o.say(<span class="string">'foo'</span>)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// 42</span></span><br><span class="line">o.say(<span class="string">'bar'</span>)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// throws Error('nope')</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>This is great! But the thrown error does NOT tell us what the arguments were that did not match the expected ones. In order to show the arguments that were used to call the stub (and that were unexpected) we can use <code>stub.callsFake()</code> to serialize the arguments. Now the calling code can be found and changed very quickly, even in an unfamiliar codebase.</p><figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="title">throwError</span>(<span class="params">a</span>) </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">throw</span> <span class="keyword">new</span> <span class="built_in">Error</span>(<span class="string">`Cannot call this stub with argument <span class="subst">$&#123;a&#125;</span>`</span>)</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line">sinon.stub(o, <span class="string">'say'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">  .callsFake(throwError) <span class="comment">// everything else</span></span><br><span class="line">  .withArgs(<span class="string">'foo'</span>).returns(<span class="number">42</span>)</span><br><span class="line">o.say(<span class="string">'bar'</span>)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// throws Error('Cannot call this stub with argument bar')</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>I even wrote a utility <a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/not-allowed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not-allowed</a> that does a good job serializing the arguments and throwing the error.</p><figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> notAllowed = <span class="built_in">require</span>(<span class="string">'not-allowed'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">sinon.stub(o, <span class="string">'say'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">  .callsFake(notAllowed)</span><br><span class="line">  .withArgs(<span class="string">'foo'</span>).returns(<span class="number">42</span>)</span><br><span class="line">o.say(<span class="string">'bar'</span>, <span class="string">'bar'</span>, <span class="number">42</span>)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// Error: Not allowed to call this function with arguments</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">//    foo bar 42</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Perfect, no confusion here.</p>]]></content>

    <title>Painless Dependency Upgrades with Renovate App</title>
    <link href="https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/renovate-app/"/>
    <id>https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/renovate-app/</id>
    <published>2018-03-14T04:00:00.000Z</published>
    <updated>2018-03-16T14:07:30.000Z</updated>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/~bahmutov" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a lot of NPM packages</a>. Like &quot;more than a 400&quot; a lot. Every package falls behind its dependencies as soon as it is published to the NPM registry. Periodically I get new GitHub issues <a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/available-versions/pull/29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like this</a> one asking me to upgrade a particular dependency and publish a new version to get around a bug or a known security issue.</p><p><img src="/blog/images/renovate-app/update-dependency-pr.png" alt="Pull request to update a vulnerable dependency"></p><p>Manual dependency upgrades are soooo boring. Grab the code, install dependency, increment version for a dependency, run the tests... Boring! So I have written a command line tool <a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/next-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener">next-update</a> to automate this process. The tool helps <em>a lot</em>. But it is still a hustle to run the tool - remember, the number of out of date dependencies is constantly growing, while my time is pretty much constant.</p><h2><span id="next-update-travis">next-update-travis</span></h2><p>So I have automated running <code>next-update</code> - by periodically running it as a <a href="../slow-updates/">Travis cron job</a>. Here is the tool called <a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/next-update-travis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">next-update-travis</a> in action - each Travis build marked &quot;Cron&quot; is the automated dependency update check. Successful updates are committed to <code>master</code> triggering another &quot;normal&quot; Travis build marked with an orange arrow in the screenshot below.</p><p><img src="/blog/images/renovate-app/updated-deps-build-history.png" alt="Updating dependencies using next-update-travis using Travis Cron job"></p><p>While that works, this approach lacks any flexibility. I could only test dependency upgrade and merge the result - I could not review it. Yes, I could change the code to open a pull request, but then the tool would require a lot more to be useful. It would need logic to NOT open multiple branches for the same dependency, merge some dependency upgrades but not others, etc. So I needed a more flexible solution.</p><h2><span id="greenkeeperio">greenkeeper.io</span></h2><p>My first impulse was to look at the service offered by my friends from <a href="https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release" target="_blank" rel="noopener">semantic-release</a> organization. After all - they have written the only tool I <em>always use</em> to publish my NPM packages! They must know how to organize the workflow that makes dependency updates painless. In fact they do have a great tool called <a href="https://greenkeeper.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">greenkeeper.io</a> to be installed as a GitHub application. Free for public repos, it monitors all versions of your dependencies and opens pull requests when a new version comes out.</p><p><img src="/blog/images/renovate-app/greenkeeper.png" alt="A typical pull request from Greenkeeper.io"></p><p>The onboarding process is <em>very intuitive</em>, and the updates start flowing a few seconds after installing the application. The pull requests are very intelligent and are tied to the CI statuses. Just review the changelog for a dependency included in the pull request and merge it! The app even merges multiple dependency version updates into a single pull request and rebases it when the master changes.</p><p>But many, many pull requests opened for a couple of my repositories soon overwhelmed me. Here is a screenshot of a relatively small project - see all these pull requests from Greenkeeper?! It looks even worse for the closed pull requests - 9 out of 15 closed PRs are dependency updates.</p><p><img src="/blog/images/renovate-app/greenkeeper-prs.png" alt="Many open Greenkeeper.io pull requests"></p><p>Often, I am looking at a pull request from Greenkeeper.io to merge a &quot;patch&quot; dependency upgrade and ask myself &quot;why can&#39;t Greenkeeper merge this pull request automatically?&quot; If my code is well tested, if the update is just a &quot;patch&quot; from a trusted library, and if the CI tests are passing - that should be a no-brainer! Yet there is no such option. So I need to continue my search.</p><h2><span id="greenkeeper-keeper">greenkeeper-keeper</span></h2><p>I found <a href="https://github.com/greenkeeper-keeper/meta" target="_blank" rel="noopener">greenkeeper-keeper</a> by the great <a href="https://matt.travi.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matt Travi</a> (Hi Matt!) that can automate merging of &quot;green&quot; pull requests from Greenkeeper. Yet I would need to run the <code>greenkeeper-keeper</code> server myself ... and I already have too many services running and would prefer to avoid adding anything else to my plate. But I know Matt is going to make an awesome tool and service for dependency management some time in the future.</p><h2><span id="renovateapp">RenovateApp</span></h2><p>Then I tried <a href="https://renovateapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Renovate App</a> from <a href="https://github.com/rarkins" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rhys Arkins</a> with whom I have a pleasure of talking from time to time about dependency management. Again, this application is a GitHub app, which means I can just select a few public repositories via GitHub configuration page - and it is up and running!</p><p><img src="/blog/images/renovate-app/renovate-repos.png" alt="Allow RenovateApp to work with a few repos"></p><p>A good example project where you can see Renovate App running is my <a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/snap-shot-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bahmutov/snap-shot-it</a>.</p><p>RenovateApp has a <a href="https://renovateapp.com/docs/configuration-reference/configuration-options" target="_blank" rel="noopener">huge number of configuration options</a>. But to start I placed a simple JSON file into my repositories (or I can just wait for the first pull request from the <code>renovate[bot]</code> to add this file to my repository). Here is the simplest configuration I tried</p><figure class="highlight json"><figcaption><span>renovate.json</span></figcaption><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="attr">"extends"</span>: [<span class="string">"config:base"</span>],</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="attr">"automerge"</span>: <span class="literal">true</span>,</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="attr">"major"</span>: &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="attr">"automerge"</span>: <span class="literal">false</span></span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>My project will use mostly the default settings (<code>config:base</code>), but will allow Renovate to <em>automerge</em> passing pull requests after a short period of time. This short period of time is about 1 hour and is very convenient because I can look at the pull request and merge it myself quickly.</p><p>Each pull request from RenovateApp has the commit log between the current version of the dependency and the target one. For example see <a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/snap-shot-it/pull/42" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this pull request</a></p><p><img src="/blog/images/renovate-app/renovate-pr-notes.png" alt="Pull request has the relevant changelog for the dependency"></p><p>The pull requests are quickly adding up, but there are configuration options that allow limiting their total number and frequency to avoid too much noise.</p><p><img src="/blog/images/renovate-app/renovate-prs.png" alt="Open pull requests from the Renovate App"></p><p>Notice that some pull requests are <code>chore(...)</code> and some are <code>fix(...)</code>. By default (this can be configured), production dependency upgrades get message <code>fix(...)</code> triggering publishing of a new &quot;fix&quot; release of my NPM module (if I have configured semantic release). Updates to the <code>devDependencies</code> are only getting a <code>chore(...)</code> commit message, NOT triggering a new version release.</p><p>No need to worry about all these pull requests because ... most of them will be merged automatically!</p><p><img src="/blog/images/renovate-app/renovate-commits.png" alt="Passing PRs are merged automatically"></p><p>Look at the <code>renovate-bot</code> chugging along, moving code into the <code>master</code> without any effort! Of course I must <a href="../tags/testing/">set up good testing</a> for my repositories to avoid accidentally breaking things. The automerging is disabled for &quot;major&quot; dependency updates. Thus a relatively dangerous upgrade from Lodash 3.x.x to 4.x.x will require my review and approval, while the backwards-compatible minor and patch updates are merged by the Renovate bot. When <code>semantic-release</code> publishes a new version it even writes a comment under the pull request to tell the new NPM version; isn&#39;t it great when tools play nicely together?</p><p><img src="/blog/images/renovate-app/publish-note-on-pr.png" alt="Published version comment"></p><p>I have limited my initial exploration of Renovate App to just updating dependencies, but there are <a href="https://renovateapp.com/docs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a lot of other things it could do</a>. I hope to investigate the app further in the future. Renovate App looks like a winner.</p><p>Just to mark every repo that has Renovate installed I created a couple of badges that look like this <a href="https://renovateapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/renovate-app-blue.svg" alt="renovate-app badge"></a></p><p>Below is the Markdown markup.</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">[![renovate-app badge][renovate-badge]][renovate-app]</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">[renovate-badge]: https://img.shields.io/badge/renovate-app-blue.svg</span><br><span class="line">[renovate-app]: https://renovateapp.com/</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Feel free to use these in your README files.</p><h2><span id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</span></h2><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/next-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener">next-update</a> is my &quot;go to&quot; tool for upgrading dependencies from command line</li><li><a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/next-update-travis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">next-update-travis</a> is a great tool to keep dependencies up to date for small well tested projects</li><li><a href="https://greenkeeper.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">greenkeeper.io</a> is awesome if you plan to review every dependency update</li><li><a href="https://github.com/greenkeeper-keeper/meta" target="_blank" rel="noopener">greenkeeper-keeper</a> is a small add-on service to automerge passing dependency updates</li><li><a href="https://renovateapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RenovateApp</a> seems like a tool I will be using from now on.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you look at <a href="https://github.com/hyperapp/awesome" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hyperapp examples</a> or even simplest counter example, you will see how it deals with state updates. Here is a typical example - incrementing and decrementing a counter.</p><p><img src="../images/hyperapp-module/hyperapp-import.jpg" alt="Hyperapp works inside script type=&quot;module&quot;"></p><p>Hyperapp is nice - it passes the complete state object to every action function, allowing every action to be pure if it wants to be. But the state object is the single source of truth, which means that sometimes actions have to work with properties deep inside the object. Even the above example - there is a lot of boilerplate in dealing with the <code>count</code> property.</p><figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> actions = &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  down: <span class="function"><span class="params">()</span> =&gt;</span> state =&gt; (&#123; <span class="attr">count</span>: state.count - <span class="number">1</span> &#125;),</span><br><span class="line">  up: <span class="function"><span class="params">()</span> =&gt;</span> state =&gt; (&#123; <span class="attr">count</span>: state.count + <span class="number">1</span> &#125;)</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Every action has to get the desired property, compute its new value and return the new state object (or at least changed key). Here is how we can simplify this code using <a href="http://ramdajs.com/docs/#lens" target="_blank" rel="noopener">functional lenses</a> implemented in Ramda library.</p><p>First, notice that <code>up</code> action for example always works with property <code>count</code> of an object passed to it. We can create <em>a lens</em> that will &quot;look&quot; at the property <code>count</code> using <a href="http://ramdajs.com/docs/#lensProp" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>R.lensProp</code></a> function.</p><figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> &#123;lensProp&#125; <span class="keyword">from</span> <span class="string">'ramda'</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> countLens = lensProp(<span class="string">'count'</span>)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>If we have a lens, and we know <em>how</em> we want to change the value, we can create new function that will be ready to increment the <code>count</code> property.<figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> &#123;lensProp, over&#125; <span class="keyword">from</span> <span class="string">'ramda'</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> incrementCount = over(lensProp(<span class="string">'count'</span>), x =&gt; x + <span class="number">1</span>)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>Of course, Ramda comes with increment function <a href="http://ramdajs.com/docs/#inc" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>R.inc</code></a>, so we don&#39;t have to write one ourselves</p><figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> &#123;lensProp, over, inc&#125; <span class="keyword">from</span> <span class="string">'ramda'</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> incrementCount = over(lensProp(<span class="string">'count'</span>), inc)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Function <code>incrementCount</code> is waiting for an object to be passed in. That object should have <code>count</code> property, and it better be a number!</p><figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> incrementCount = over(lensProp(<span class="string">'count'</span>), inc)</span><br><span class="line">incrementCount(&#123; <span class="attr">count</span>: <span class="number">10</span> &#125;) <span class="comment">// &#123;count: 11&#125;</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Nice! We can create a &quot;decrement count&quot; function similarly. We can even reuse the same <code>over(lensProp(&#39;count&#39;))</code> functions, thanks to all Ramda methods being curried. My final code looks tight and reads almost English-like.</p><figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> &#123; lensProp, over, inc, dec &#125; <span class="keyword">from</span> <span class="string">'ramda'</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> count = over(lensProp(<span class="string">'count'</span>))</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">export</span> <span class="keyword">const</span> actions = &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  down: <span class="function"><span class="params">()</span> =&gt;</span> count(dec),</span><br><span class="line">  up: <span class="function"><span class="params">()</span> =&gt;</span> count(inc)</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>And that&#39;s how you can clean up actions mutating state in Hyperapp. You can find the change to my counter example in commit <a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/hyperapp-counter-jsx-example/commit/0e2915c9fddfa179c1d5d17cb3ffb8b996955916" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bahmutov/hyperapp-counter-jsx-example/commit/0e2915</a></p><h2><span id="related-blog-posts">Related blog posts</span></h2><ul><li><a href="../tags/hyperapp/">My Hyperapp posts</a></li><li><a href="../lenses/">Using functional lenses to modify objects by example</a></li><li><a href="../quick-refactoring/">Quick functional refactoring</a></li></ul>]]></content>

    <title>Testing ES6 Module in Cypress Electron Browser</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you have a tiny framework, importing it as ES6 module is super convenient for quick demos. For example <a href="https://hyperapp.js.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hyperapp</a> can be imported and used right away in most browsers. <a href="https://twitter.com/okwolf/status/950635170725445632" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Original tweet</a>.</p><p><img src="../images/hyperapp-module/hyperapp-import.jpg" alt="Hyperapp works inside script type=&quot;module&quot;"></p><p>This is awesome - importing ES6 modules works <a href="https://jakearchibald.com/2017/es-modules-in-browsers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with some caveats</a>. For other browsers we do want to build ES5 bundle as an alternative to <code>&lt;script type=&quot;module&quot;&gt;</code> syntax. But what about testing? Can we test the above Hyperapp without transpiling it?</p><p>If we take my favorite test runner <a href="https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cypress</a> - and it is my favorite in part because I am building it, and in part because it is awesome - yes, you can. Cypress can control multiple browsers. Chrome already supports <code>&lt;script type=&quot;module&quot;&gt;</code> syntax. The built-in Electron browsers does not, and that&#39;s a shame - Cypress records video of the Electron browser on CI which is a great advantage when a test fails. In this blog post I will show how to add es6 module support to Electron browser.</p><p><strong>note:</strong> you can find the source code in the repository <a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/hyperapp-es6-module-cypress" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bahmutov/hyperapp-es6-module-cypress</a></p><p>I copied the example code from the tweet into <code>index.html</code>, and have written a simple test for the counter program.</p><figure class="highlight js"><figcaption><span>cypress/integration/spec.js</span></figcaption><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">beforeEach(<span class="function"><span class="params">()</span> =&gt;</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  cy.visit(<span class="string">'index.html'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">&#125;)</span><br><span class="line">it(<span class="string">'loads'</span>, () =&gt; &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  cy.contains(<span class="string">'h1'</span>, <span class="string">'0'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">  cy</span><br><span class="line">    .contains(<span class="string">'+'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">    .click()</span><br><span class="line">    .click()</span><br><span class="line">  cy.contains(<span class="string">'h1'</span>, <span class="string">'2'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">&#125;)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>The test passes when Cypress uses Chrome browser, but fails in Electron - because no code is executing. Electron simply ignores the <code>type=&quot;module&quot;</code> script it does not know how to handle.</p><p><img src="../images/hyperapp-module/module-does-not-run.png" alt="Electron skips ES6 module script"></p><p>We need to somehow transpile ES6 module code (and any other script it might load using <code>import</code> statement) into &quot;normal&quot; bundle. In Node I would use a bundler like <a href="https://rollupjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rollup</a>, but what can I use in the browser? I found <a href="https://github.com/ModuleLoader/browser-es-module-loader#readme" target="_blank" rel="noopener">browser-es-module-loader</a> - while it warns that it is not suitable for production, this code is good enough to be used during testing.

You can see it in action yourself at <a href="https://sdras.github.io/array-explorer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://sdras.github.io/array-explorer/</a>. Here is me adding items to an array and seeing the result and relevant documentation.</p><p><img src="/blog/images/array-explorer/array-explorer.gif" alt="Adding items to an array"></p><p>The source for this project is available at <a href="https://github.com/sdras/array-explorer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">github.com/sdras/array-explorer</a> and is written by wonderfully productive <a href="https://sarahdrasnerdesign.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sarah Drasner</a>. I have noticed that the project does not have any tests. This is a great opportunity to quickly write a few end-to-end tests using <a href="https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cypress</a> test runner. Just a few high level tests can exercise the entire application <em>as if a real user was interacting with the page</em>.</p><p>Let us start testing!</p><p><strong>Hint:</strong> Sarah has a sister project <a href="https://github.com/sdras/object-explorer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sdras/object-explorer</a> that <em>you</em> could test the same way!

Everything is green!</p><h2><span id="second-test">Second test</span></h2><p>Let us confirm that the page is greeting us with the name of the project &quot;JavaScript Array Explorer&quot;. For finding unique text on the page, I usually use <a href="https://on.cypress.io/contains" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>cy.contains(text)</code></a> command. In this case this text might appear somewhere else on the page. To avoid accidents like this, let us make the selector more precise. Recently we have introduced <a href="https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/917" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CSS Selector Playground</a> tool. Click on its target icon next to the url bar and hover over the text to see its &quot;best&quot; selector - in this case it suggests using <code>h1</code> selector.</p><p><img src="/blog/images/array-explorer/greeting.png" alt="CSS Playground suggests using h1"></p><p>Let us update our first test to confirm that the text really greets us after load.</p><figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">it(<span class="string">'greets us'</span>, () =&gt; &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  cy.contains(<span class="string">'h1'</span>, <span class="string">'JavaScript Array Explorer'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">&#125;)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Perfect, the test passes.</p><h2><span id="covering-primary-methods">Covering primary methods</span></h2><p>There are 7 primary methods Array Explorer teaches: from &quot;add items or other arrays&quot; to &quot;something else&quot;. We really should create suites of tests for each primary method. In this example I will write just a few example tests. Let me start with &quot;something else&quot; primary method, that has &quot;length of the array&quot; secondary option.</p><p>As suggested by the &quot;CSS Selector Playground&quot; helper (or by looking up in the DevTools), the first drop down choice can be queried with <code>#firstmethod</code> selector. The method options can be set in the <code>#methodoptions</code> drop down. Here is our test.</p><figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">context(<span class="string">'something else'</span>, () =&gt; &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  it(<span class="string">'shows length of an array'</span>, () =&gt; &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    cy.get(<span class="string">'#firstmethod'</span>).select(<span class="string">'something else'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">    cy.get(<span class="string">'#methodoptions'</span>).select(<span class="string">'find the length of the array'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;)</span><br><span class="line">&#125;)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p><img src="/blog/images/array-explorer/array-length.png" alt="Array length"></p><p>While the test is running I see Cypress opening drop downs, finding the right choice, selecting it. If an element with a given selector was missing and did not appear for the command&#39;s timeout duration, an intelligent error message with a screenshot would appear. But so far everything is going great.</p><p>We need to add an assertion to the test. We have not confirmed that the app actually shows an example of the array length property. And we have not confirmed that the output text area is really showing the right answer. Let us do this. The app works in steps</p><ol><li>Code appears (with slow type effect) in the first box <code>.usage1</code></li><li>Then the answer appears in box <code>.usage2 &gt; .usage-code</code></li></ol><p>Under the hood, the Array Explorer has input and output code as text already in the DOM, just hidden. The input code is supposed to &quot;produce&quot; the output text - it has <code>console.log(...)</code> statements, but of course they are not actually executing. So in our &quot;length of array&quot; example the input looks like this</p><figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">let</span> arr = [<span class="number">5</span>, <span class="number">1</span>, <span class="number">8</span>];</span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">console</span>.log(arr.length);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>The output text is <code>3</code> and is initially hidden. Only after delayed &quot;type&quot; effect it appears.</p><p>In our test, we can grab the input code as text, and the output text, and we should make sure the output value is visible <em>and correct</em>. To make sure the value is correct, I will <code>eval</code> the input text. Because the input uses <code>console.(...)</code> to &quot;print&quot; the result, before evaluating the code, I will set up a spy on <code>console.log</code> method using built-in [<code>cy.spy</code>][spy] method. Here is the entire test - it kind of looks scary, but it is really universal and can work with any array explorer example!</p><figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br><span class="line">20</span><br><span class="line">21</span><br><span class="line">22</span><br><span class="line">23</span><br><span class="line">24</span><br><span class="line">25</span><br><span class="line">26</span><br><span class="line">27</span><br><span class="line">28</span><br><span class="line">29</span><br><span class="line">30</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">it(<span class="string">'shows length of an array'</span>, () =&gt; &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  cy.get(<span class="string">'#firstmethod'</span>).select(<span class="string">'something else'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">  cy.get(<span class="string">'#methodoptions'</span>).select(<span class="string">'find the length of the array'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="comment">// compute the output from input</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">let</span> output</span><br><span class="line">  cy</span><br><span class="line">    .get(<span class="string">'.exampleoutput2'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">    .invoke(<span class="string">'text'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">    .then(<span class="function"><span class="params">t</span> =&gt;</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">      output = t</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;)</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="comment">// set up spy on `console.log` before</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="comment">// we can call `eval(input code)`</span></span><br><span class="line">  cy.spy(<span class="built_in">console</span>, <span class="string">'log'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">  cy.get(<span class="string">'.usage1'</span>).then(<span class="function"><span class="params">v</span> =&gt;</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">const</span> input = v.text()</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment">// evaluate the input code - we are already spying on console.log!</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="built_in">eval</span>(input)</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment">// the value comes from DOM - so it needs to be</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment">// converted before we can compare it to the</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment">// compute value</span></span><br><span class="line">    expect(<span class="built_in">console</span>.log).to.have.been.calledWith(<span class="built_in">JSON</span>.parse(output))</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment">// make sure the output becomes visible</span></span><br><span class="line">    cy</span><br><span class="line">      .get(<span class="string">'.exampleoutput2'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">      .should(<span class="string">'have.css'</span>, <span class="string">'opacity'</span>, <span class="string">'1'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">      <span class="comment">// and the right value appears</span></span><br><span class="line">      .and(<span class="string">'contain'</span>, <span class="built_in">String</span>(output))</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;)</span><br><span class="line">&#125;)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Here is the test in action.

The test uses <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer#readme" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Puppeteer</a> to verify that vue-cli scaffolds a project correctly, that dev server is serving a Vue app, and that changing the app&#39;s source file reloads the page, and it shows updated text.

But even discounting all the code outside the function <code>runTest</code>, count how many lines of code are <em>related to the test</em> and how many lines of code are dealing with starting the browser, finding the element, waiting for the text and then cleaning up. Puppeteer is a great tool, but it is NOT a testing tool specifically; it is a general Chrome browser automation tool. Thus a tool <em>specifically designed</em> to be a testing tool around a real browser might be more convenient to use in this case.</p><h2><span id="cypress">Cypress</span></h2><p>One such tool that specifically focuses on solving browser management, element selection, automated retries and other developer experience issues common during testing is <a href="https://www.cypress.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cypress.io</a> (full disclosure: I have joined Cypress team in 2017 after being a super happy user for almost a year). Let me try writing a similar server test using Cypress for comparison.</p><p>I prefer working on a new project rather than forking <code>vue-cli</code> to avoid distractions of a large code base. Let us create a new Vue project to use as a test playground. After installing <code>vue-cli</code> globally, I need to scaffold a project with hot module reloading (you can find finished project at <a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/test-vue-cli" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bahmutov/test-vue-cli</a>).</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">$ vue list</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  Available official templates:</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  ★  browserify - A full-featured Browserify + vueify setup with hot-reload, linting &amp; unit testing.</span><br><span class="line">  ★  browserify-simple - A simple Browserify + vueify setup for quick prototyping.</span><br><span class="line">  ★  pwa - PWA template for vue-cli based on the webpack template</span><br><span class="line">  ★  simple - The simplest possible Vue setup in a single HTML file</span><br><span class="line">  ★  webpack - A full-featured Webpack + vue-loader setup with hot reload, linting, testing &amp; css extraction.</span><br><span class="line">  ★  webpack-simple - A simple Webpack + vue-loader setup for quick prototyping.</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Pick <code>webpack-simple</code> and run <code>vue init</code> with full template name (to get around 404 response I am getting today) <a href="https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack-simple" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vuejs-templates/webpack-simple</a>.</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">$ vue init vuejs-templates/webpack-simple</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">?

We can see each step of the test in the command log on the left.</p><p><img src="/blog/images/test-vue-cli/updated.png" alt="Updated text test"></p><p>Here is the important part. Cypress is really optimized for testing. Do you want to see why the first assertion <code>cy.contains(&#39;h1&#39;, message)</code> passed? Hover over or click on step 2 to see the state of the DOM <em>at that moment</em>. We are finding the right text at the right location on the page - not accidentally matching some other text that might be on the page.</p><p><img src="/blog/images/test-vue-cli/contains.png" alt="Contains text"></p><p>Click on the next test command - <code>READFILE</code>. It shows a popup message &quot;Printed output to your console&quot;. Open the DevTools (Cypress is after all just an Electron app, or it can control Chrome browser) to see the file read and its contents.</p><p><img src="/blog/images/test-vue-cli/read-file.png" alt="cy.readFile"></p><p>Isn&#39;t this convenient during working with tests to see all data related to each step of the test?</p><h2><span id="dealing-with-initial-state">Dealing with initial state</span></h2><p>There is one more note that I must make. You should strive to make each test independent from any other test, even independent from <em>its previous run</em>. In our case we have <em>changed</em> the file <code>src/App.vue</code>, and if we reload the test, it fails to find the original text &quot;Welcome to Your Vue.js App&quot;. Our previous run changed the source file, and our test did not start from the clean state.</p><p><img src="/blog/images/test-vue-cli/failed.png" alt="Running test again fails"></p><p>Again, the above screenshot shows the difference between a general browser automation tool and Cypress. The reason for the failure is communicated very clearly; Cypress team pays a lot of attention to good error messages. It should be enough to look at the screenshot to immediately see the problem. In this case the app shows &quot;Updated&quot; where &quot;Welcome ...&quot; text should have been.</p><p>By the way, Cypress takes video of the entire test run by default, and screenshot after failures automatically when running on CI with <code>npm run cypress:run</code> command; there is nothing to configure.</p><p>Ok, let us fix the test. We can modify the <code>App.vue</code> file <em>after</em> the test - but that is an <a href="https://on.cypress.io/best-practices#Using-after-or-afterEach-hooks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anti-pattern to avoid</a>. You never know if the test failed or crashed - the clean up after the test is <em>not guaranteed</em>. So let us make sure the test starts with expected file.</p><p>There are many things we could do in this case, but I pick using a fixture. Copy the original <code>src/App.vue</code> to <code>cypress/fixtures/App.vue</code>. Before our test, load the fixture and save it as <code>src/App.vue</code>.</p><figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">beforeEach(<span class="function"><span class="params">()</span> =&gt;</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  cy.fixture(<span class="string">'App.vue'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">    .then(<span class="function"><span class="params">source</span> =&gt;</span> cy.writeFile(<span class="string">'src/App.vue'</span>, source))</span><br><span class="line">&#125;)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> message = <span class="string">'Welcome to Your Vue.js App'</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> setNewText = <span class="function"><span class="params">source</span> =&gt;</span> source.replace(message, <span class="string">'Updated'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">it(<span class="string">'serves'</span>, () =&gt; &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  cy.visit(<span class="string">'http://localhost:8080'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">  cy.contains(<span class="string">'h1'</span>, message)</span><br><span class="line">  cy</span><br><span class="line">    .readFile(<span class="string">'src/App.vue'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">    .then(setNewText)</span><br><span class="line">    .then(<span class="function"><span class="params">source</span> =&gt;</span> cy.writeFile(<span class="string">'src/App.vue'</span>, source))</span><br><span class="line">  cy.contains(<span class="string">'h1'</span>, <span class="string">'Updated'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">&#125;)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>The test reliably passes any time we run it.

And it is already designed &quot;the right way&quot; - the names of properties we know is at first position, and the function is curried.We can even move it out of <code>addInfo</code> into its own <code>.then(...)</code> step.</p><figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">cypress.run(...)</span><br><span class="line">  .then(R.omit([<span class="string">'screenshots'</span>, <span class="string">'video'</span>, <span class="string">'version'</span>]))</span><br><span class="line">  .then(addInfo(app))</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Now let&#39;s add the <code>app</code> property. There is no built-in method for this - and you will see why shortly (there is more general and powerful one). We could make our own tiny function just for this.

Our function <code>setProp</code> mutates the object - making it harder to rely on it. Any object passed into <code>setProp</code> will be forever changed. Or not, you really cannot tell in JavaScript. So lets look at what Ramda can give us. Working with object properties is done via <em>lenses</em>. First we create a lens to look at specific property <code>app</code>. Then we use a different function to set a specific value via this lens on an object <em>that will arrive later</em>.</p><figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> lens = R.lensProp(<span class="string">'app'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">cypress.run(...)</span><br><span class="line">  .then(R.omit([<span class="string">'screenshots'</span>, <span class="string">'video'</span>, <span class="string">'version'</span>]))</span><br><span class="line">  .then(R.set(lens, app))</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>We don&#39;t need to make <code>lens</code> object separately, we can just make it in place when needed.</p><figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">cypress.run(...)</span><br><span class="line">  .then(R.omit([<span class="string">'screenshots'</span>, <span class="string">'video'</span>, <span class="string">'version'</span>]))</span><br><span class="line">  .then(R.set(R.lensProp(<span class="string">'app'</span>), app))</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Perfect, remember why we have started this? So that our function <code>appInfo</code> is testable. Look what has happened now - we have eliminated <code>appInfo</code> completely. Instead we have two very simple functions from a well tested and widely used library. It is very unlikely that anything will go wrong in <code>R.omit</code> or <code>R.set</code> functions, so we don&#39;t have to worry.</p><p>Next we should look at the <code>addColors</code> function. My original implementation is using <a href="https://github.com/chalk/chalk#readme" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chalk</a>.</p><figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> addColors = <span class="function"><span class="params">results</span> =&gt;</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  results.failures = results.failures</span><br><span class="line">    ? chalk.red(results.failures)</span><br><span class="line">    : chalk.green(results.failures)</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">return</span> results</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Notice the similarity to our previous refactoring - we are working with specific property on an object that is yet to arrive. So we will make a lens to &quot;look&quot; at the property <code>failures</code> and we are going to modify its value and will put it back into the object. Or rather we will make a new object with updated property (thanks immutability).</p><figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> failuresLens = R.lensProp(<span class="string">'failures'</span>)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> colorFailures = <span class="function"><span class="params">n</span> =&gt;</span> (n ? chalk.red(n) : chalk.green(n))</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> addColors = <span class="function"><span class="params">results</span> =&gt;</span> R.over(failuresLens, colorFailures, results)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Notice how we split the function into its atomic operations? And the great thing - the last line is NOT needed - all it does is passing <code>results</code> as the last argument to <code>R.over</code>. Since every function in Ramda is curried, we can get rid of it.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One thing that always trips me up in JavaScript is its event-driven nature.A piece of code written &quot;normally&quot; does not execute linearly.

But things become much more complicated when youwrite &quot;regular&quot; Node or browser code. It is difficult because all the sudden, the callbacksthat look absolutely the same are NOT called synchronously. Instead they will be called some time in the future. Here is the &quot;simple&quot; code that causes all the confusion in the world.</p><figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="title">asyncIdentity</span>(<span class="params">x, cb</span>) </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  setTimeout(<span class="function"><span class="params">()</span> =&gt;</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="string">'returning x ='</span>, x)</span><br><span class="line">    cb(x)</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;, <span class="number">0</span>)</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> result = asyncIdentity(<span class="string">'foo'</span>, (arg) =&gt; &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="string">'callback value ='</span>, arg)</span><br><span class="line">&#125;)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="string">'result ='</span>, result)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>To the outside caller function <code>asyncIdentity</code> looks almost the same as our previousfunction <code>identity</code>.

And notice that we no longer get anyresult - there is no concept of result available immediately. Instead the computed value will bepassed to the callback function by scheduling it to run - to the back of the event queue it goes!</p><figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">setTimeout(<span class="function"><span class="params">()</span> =&gt;</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="string">'returning x ='</span>, x)</span><br><span class="line">  cb(x)</span><br><span class="line">&#125;, <span class="number">0</span>)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>If only this function did not use <code>setTimeout</code>! Then it would not cause any problems in tracingthe flow of run time calls.</p><p>We get around callbacks. We now got Promises - a way to schedule computation to receive a computed value eventually and call callbacks using <code>.then</code> method, rather than byconvention.</p><figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="title">promisedIdentity</span>(<span class="params">x</span>) </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="keyword">new</span> <span class="built_in">Promise</span>(<span class="function">(<span class="params">resolve, reject</span>) =&gt;</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    setTimeout(<span class="function"><span class="params">()</span> =&gt;</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">      <span class="built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="string">'returning x ='</span>, x)</span><br><span class="line">      resolve(x)</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;, <span class="number">0</span>)</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;)</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line">promisedIdentity(<span class="string">'foo'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">  .then(<span class="function"><span class="params">arg</span> =&gt;</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="string">'callback value ='</span>, arg)</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>This program acts &quot;more sensibly&quot;. The output shows that the code inside <code>promisedIdentity</code>first runs, then the callback inside &quot;then&quot; executes. Since &quot;then&quot; callback is below the promisewe almost read the program top to bottom, like a regular synchronous program. This is much betterthan jumping up and down when reading a source code with callbacks.</p><p>Small aside. There is now <code>async / await</code> to force asynchronous code to read &quot;normally&quot;.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Who loves waiting on CI to finish testing multiple files? Not me. Luckily modern CIs support isolation and running multiple test jobs in many containers, splitting single sequence of test jobs into parallel runs. My favorite system for doing this is GitLabCI, but the same can be done in many other popular CIs. This blog post shows how to set up parallel test runs in CircleCI (v2) and on TravisCI. If I do not write this down I will forget and will have to reinvent this in the future, I am sure!</p><h2><span id="example-setup">Example setup</span></h2><p>Imagine you have a single repository with many folders with tests. The <a href="https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-recipes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cypress/cypress-example-recipes</a> is a good example. Different recipes are subfolders in the <code>examples</code> folder - there are more than 20 folders!</p><figure class="highlight shell"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta">$</span><span class="bash"> exa -l examples</span></span><br><span class="line">drwxr-xr-x - irinakous 13 Dec 16:28 blogs__codepen-demo</span><br><span class="line">drwxr-xr-x - irinakous 13 Dec 16:28 blogs__direct-control-angular</span><br><span class="line">drwxr-xr-x - irinakous 28 Nov 11:16 blogs__e2e-api-testing</span><br><span class="line">drwxr-xr-x - irinakous 13 Dec 10:12 blogs__e2e-snapshots</span><br><span class="line">...</span><br><span class="line">drwxr-xr-x - irinakous 28 Nov 11:16 testing-dom__tab-handling-links</span><br><span class="line">drwxr-xr-x - irinakous 28 Nov 11:16 unit-testing__application-code</span><br><span class="line">drwxr-xr-x - irinakous 28 Nov 11:16 unit-testing__react-enzyme</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>A single script going through every folder, running end-to-end tests takes about 15 minutes. There are two test services where we run tests: <a href="https://circleci.com/gh/cypress-io/workflows/cypress-example-recipes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Circle</a> and <a href="https://travis-ci.org/cypress-io/cypress-example-recipes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Travis</a>. First, let us convert sequence to parallel jobs on Circle CI.</p><h2><span id="circle">Circle</span></h2><p>CircleCI v2 has introduces <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/workflows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">workflows</a> that are extremely powerful. Think of a workflow as a series of jobs; for our purposes every job is independent. Here is how we can define a workflow - we will name each job after a folder.</p><figure class="highlight yaml"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="attr">workflows:</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">  version:</span> <span class="number">2</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="comment"># when adding new example subfolder with a recipe</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="comment"># add its name here to "create" CircleCI job</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">  all-recipes:</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">    jobs:</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="bullet">      -</span> <span class="string">blogs__codepen-demo</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="bullet">      -</span> <span class="string">blogs__direct-control-angular</span></span><br><span class="line">      <span class="string">...</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="bullet">      -</span> <span class="string">unit-testing__react-enzyme</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Now we need to define each job. We need to specify the Docker container the job should run in, any environment variables to set and the actual job steps. While we could copy and paste these steps, in reality all our test job are the same - only the folder is different. So we can use YAML template feature to create common job definition and only substitute the <em>job name</em>. Here is how it looks:</p><figure class="highlight yaml"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br><span class="line">20</span><br><span class="line">21</span><br><span class="line">22</span><br><span class="line">23</span><br><span class="line">24</span><br><span class="line">25</span><br><span class="line">26</span><br><span class="line">27</span><br><span class="line">28</span><br><span class="line">29</span><br><span class="line">30</span><br><span class="line">31</span><br><span class="line">32</span><br><span class="line">33</span><br><span class="line">34</span><br><span class="line">35</span><br><span class="line">36</span><br><span class="line">37</span><br><span class="line">38</span><br><span class="line">39</span><br><span class="line">40</span><br><span class="line">41</span><br><span class="line">42</span><br><span class="line">43</span><br><span class="line">44</span><br><span class="line">45</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="attr">defaults:</span> <span class="meta">&amp;defaults</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">  parallelism:</span> <span class="number">1</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">  working_directory:</span> <span class="string">~/app</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">  docker:</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">    -

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://sveltejs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Svelte.js</a> is a very interesting &quot;disappearing&quot; framework for writing web applications. Recently, the framework&#39;s crew came out with a simple centralized data store to be used with Svelte apps. The initial &quot;Hello World&quot; example application had a bug 🙃 immediately fixed by a <a href="https://github.com/sveltejs/template-store/pull/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pull request</a>. But this immediately showed me an opportunity to write a few end to end tests to prevent any future problems. Of course I picked <a href="https://www.cypress.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cypress.io</a> (full disclosure, I am VP of Engineering at Cypress) - an open source MIT-licensed test runner.</p><p>Before (and if) my pull request with E2E tests is merged into the main repo <a href="https://github.com/sveltejs/template-store" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sveltejs/template-store</a>, you can find the source and tests in <a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/template-store" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bahmutov/template-store</a> repository.</p><p>To run the web application we need to execute <code>npm run dev</code> - this runs a static web server and <a href="https://rollupjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rollup bundler</a> in watch mode. By default the app runs at <code>http://localhost:5000</code>. I have installed Cypress with <code>npm i -D cypress</code> (or just with <code>yarn add cypress</code>) and opened it once with <code>$(npm bin)/cypress open</code>. This scaffolded an empty settings file <code>cypress.json</code> in the project root. I have added the following two options there to avoid hard coding the test url.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I could not find a good example of a TodoMVC that uses in-memory data store(like <a href="https://redux.js.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Redux</a> or <a href="https://vuex.vuejs.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vuex</a>)that is synchronized against a REST backend, so I put together this example. It is based onthe <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue/tree/dev/examples/todomvc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">simplest TodoMVC using Vue.js</a> which does not require any buildsteps to run. You can find my code in the<a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/vue-vuex-todomvc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bahmutov/vue-vuex-todomvc</a> repo.</p><h2><span id="the-problem">The problem</span></h2><p>We need to add / remove Todo items in the list and store them on the backend.Our front end framework should work against a data store, but the data storeshould make calls to actually store the data on the backend.Each Todo item will have a title, a completed boolean flag and a randomid, generated on the client. Here is a typical todo item:</p><figure class="highlight json"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="attr">"title"</span>: <span class="string">"learn Italian"</span>,</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="attr">"completed"</span>: <span class="literal">false</span>,</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="attr">"id"</span>: <span class="string">"6552b6dc4b"</span></span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>There are a LOT of front end solutions to this problem at <a href="http://todomvc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">todomvc.com</a>excepts they all use browser&#39;s <code>localStorage</code> to keep the data. I wanted to have a more realisticscenario where a server is actually serving the items.</p><p>The web application should do the following 3 things:</p><ol><li>On startup, get the list of items from the server</li><li>When adding an item, it should first post the item to the server, and only then shouldadd the item to the client&#39;s data store</li><li>On deleting an item, it should delete the item from the server, and if it has beendeleted on the server, then it should delete it on the client side.</li></ol><p>In all cases, the server keeps &quot;the true state&quot;; the client-side data store is secondary, andit is updated only if the server has acknowledged the operation.</p><h2><span id="rest-backend">REST backend</span></h2><p>To implement the backend I chose the <a href="https://github.com/typicode/json-server" target="_blank" rel="noopener">json-server</a> to create the REST backend withzero code.

We can use this feature to reset items before each test for example.</p><p>We can now GET list of items from the <code>localhost:3000/todos</code> endpoints,and we can add new items to it by making a POST request.We can delete a particular item by making <code>DELETE /todos/:id</code> request.</p><h2><span id="vuex-store">Vuex store</span></h2><p>The store is pretty simple, here is its data, and the two getters that we expect to be used fromthe application.</p><figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> store = <span class="keyword">new</span> Vuex.Store(&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  state: &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    todos: [],</span><br><span class="line">    newTodo: <span class="string">''</span></span><br><span class="line">  &#125;,</span><br><span class="line">  getters: &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    newTodo: <span class="function"><span class="params">state</span> =&gt;</span> state.newTodo,</span><br><span class="line">    todos: <span class="function"><span class="params">state</span> =&gt;</span> state.todos</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>We can also have additional state there, like &quot;loading&quot; indicator, but for this tutorial I am goingto skip these details.See <a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/vue-vuex-todomvc/blob/master/app.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener">app.js</a>for the entire store.</p><p>In addition, the store is going to have mutations and actions. Mutation methods can changethe &quot;state&quot; object, and will trigger the Vue DOM updates. Thus these methods are synchronous.For example, here are mutations to set the todos array, add a single todo item, andto clear the &quot;newTodo&quot; text.</p><figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> store = <span class="keyword">new</span> Vuex.Store(&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="comment">// state</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="comment">// getters</span></span><br><span class="line">  mutations: &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    SET_TODOS (state, todos) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">      state.todos = todos</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;,</span><br><span class="line">    ADD_TODO (state, todoObject) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">      state.todos.push(todoObject)</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;,</span><br><span class="line">    CLEAR_NEW_TODO (state) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">      state.newTodo = <span class="string">''</span></span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment">// other mutations are done the same way</span></span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Actions on the other hand are not mutating the state yet.

Unfortunately, there was no recording of the event, but at least hereare some of my answers as I remember them now.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Q:</strong> Types of testing</p></blockquote><p>There is a testing pyramid; its shape is determined by the tools we have. It is sosimple to write unit tests - so a lot of them are written. It is harder to write end toend tests, so there are a few of them at the very top of the pyramid. It should really be a <a href="../testing-trapezoid/">testing trapezoid</a>.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Q:</strong> What is the difference between quality and testing?</p></blockquote><p>Quality is a property, and testing is an action. There are many ways to achievequality, testing is one of the ways. My favorite two ways of building high quality software:</p><ol><li>Having well-rested engineers. No one can avoid making costly mistakes while  putting in 70 hour work weeks for months.</li><li>Taking pride in your work. There is a difference in mass produced widgets vs artisan work. A &quot;crafty&quot; person loves what he or she is doing, and will ensure that the built product is well done.</li></ol><blockquote><p><strong>Q:</strong> Language-specific testing</p></blockquote><p>Some languages require more testing, for example JavaScript (love it or hate it) dominatesthe world, but requires additional unit tests just because it is a dynamic scriptinglanguage. As a second consideration, I think writing tests in the same language as the main code is strongly preferred.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Q:</strong> How do you ensure that your testing data accurately reflects real world production data?</p></blockquote><p>Use whatever data fits the expected use case, according to your professional judgment.Then use crash reporting software in production. As soon as the real world case appears thatyou have not considered, and it crashes the system, add it as another test data case.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Q:</strong> What advice can you give a QA tester to improve personal career?</p></blockquote><p>QA is not just about finding what is broken. It is about building what is right for thecustomer; and thus QA is a very creative role. Do not be afraid to take on moreresponsibility and insert yourself early in the process, bringing value to the product,rather than delaying it due to testing. It is a human-centric profession, which hasa lot of leeway how to collect requirements, stated and unstated, and how to communicatethese requirements and track them through the process. Some time investment will be necessary,but local meetup scene is very valuable in this regard. </p>]]></content>
